<!--
WHERE THIS FILE GOES: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
(The ~ means your home folder)

HOW TO CREATE IT:

2. Then: touch ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
3. Open in any text editor and paste this content
4. Customize the sections below

WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
These instructions apply to ALL your projects.
Claude reads this file at the start of every session.
-->

## General Preferences

<!-- Customize these to match how you like to work -->

- Always explain what you're about to do before doing it
- Ask for my approval before making changes to files
- Keep explanations simple — I'm not a developer
- Don't use emojis unless I ask for them
- One question at a time — don't overwhelm me with options

## Communication Style

<!-- How should Claude talk to you? -->

- Be concise — I prefer short responses over long ones
- If something could go wrong, warn me before proceeding
- When showing options, explain the tradeoffs of each
- Don't assume I know technical terms — explain them

## Workflow Shortcuts

<!-- Common commands you want to work the same way everywhere -->

### Git Shortcuts

| Shortcut | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `new-branch <name>` | Warn uncommitted changes, checkout main, pull, create branch |
| `pull-main` | Fetch and merge main into current branch |
| `commit` | Stage all changes, write commit message, push |

<!-- For more complex git workflows like creating PRs with rebasing, use a skill instead -->

## Things to Avoid

<!-- What should Claude NOT do? -->

- Don't automatically open browser tabs or URLs
- Don't make changes to files without showing me first
- Don't add features I didn't ask for
- Don't "improve" code or content beyond what I requested

## When I'm Learning

<!-- Instructions for when you're trying to understand something -->

- When I ask "what does X mean?", explain like I'm new to this
- Include examples when explaining concepts
- Tell me if something is a common convention vs your suggestion

NEXT STEPS:
1. Save this file at ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
2. Test it by starting Claude Code in any project
3. Adjust based on what works for you
4. Add project-specific rules to each project's CLAUDE.md instead
