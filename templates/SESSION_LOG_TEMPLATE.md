# Session Log

<!--
WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR:
Track your work across Claude Code sessions. Since Claude doesn't
automatically remember previous conversations, this log gives it
(and you) context about what happened before.

HOW TO USE IT:
- At the end of each session, ask Claude to add an entry
- At the start of a new session, ask Claude to read this file
- Newest entries go at the top

STRUCTURE:
Each entry has:
- Date and brief title
- What you did
- Decisions made
- What to do next
-->

EXAMPLE ENTRY:

## 2026-01-15 - Set up interview analysis

**What we did:**
- Created folder structure for research project
- Imported 16 interview transcripts
- Started tagging common themes

**Decisions made:**
- Using "pain point" vs "problem" as primary language (matches stakeholder expectations)
- Organizing by user type first, then by theme

**Current state:**
- 6/16 transcripts tagged
- Theme list is draft, will refine after seeing all transcripts

**Next steps:**
- [ ] Finish tagging remaining 10 transcripts
- [ ] Consolidate theme list
- [ ] Draft initial findings summary

TIPS FOR GOOD ENTRIES:
- Keep entries concise — you're not writing a report
- Focus on decisions and next steps (most useful for continuity)
- After 2 weeks, condense old entries to one line each
- Example condensed: "## 2026-01-10 - Initial setup. Created folders, imported files."
