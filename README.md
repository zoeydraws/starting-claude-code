# Starting Claude Code

A beginner guide to get Claude Code set up and start using it.

## What Is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a tool that lets you work with Claude directly in your computer's terminal (that black window with text). Claude Code can:

- Read and understand your project files
- Make edits directly (with your approval)
- Run commands for you
- Remember your preferences across sessions

Think of it as having Claude sitting next to you, able to see your screen and type for you — but always asking permission first.

**Example use cases:**

- Brainstorming ideas and finding tutorials, information, data
- Creating ASCII wireframes, prototyping in code, making changes to code
- Writing interview guides and analyzing transcripts
- Building interactive lessons or documentation sites
- Creating and updating your portfolio website
- Learning web development with a coding assistant

## Who Is This Guide For?

Anyone new to Claude Code who wants to get the baseline set up and start using it. No terminal knowledge required — you'll learn as you go.
