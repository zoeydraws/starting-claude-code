# Starting Claude Code

A beginner-friendly guide for UX researchers and Design Managers who want to use Claude Code — even if you've never touched a terminal before.

## What Is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a tool that lets you work with Claude directly in your computer's terminal (that black window with text). Instead of copy-pasting between Claude.ai and your files, Claude Code can:

- Read and understand your project files
- Make edits directly (with your approval)
- Run commands for you
- Remember your preferences across sessions

Think of it as having Claude sitting next to you, able to see your screen and type for you — but always asking permission first.

## Who Is This Guide For?

- UX researchers managing transcripts, synthesis docs, analysis
- Design managers organizing project documentation
- Anyone who works mostly in text/markdown files
- People who've never used Terminal before (that's okay!)

## Before You Start

You'll need:
- A Mac computer (this guide is Mac-focused)
- About 20 minutes for initial setup
- An Anthropic account (you can create one during setup)

No coding experience required. Seriously.
