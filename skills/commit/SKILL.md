description: Stage all changes, commit with a descriptive message, and push to remote
---

Commit and push all current changes.

## Steps

1. Run `git status` to see what's changed
2. Stage all changes with `git add .`
3. Write a clear, descriptive commit message based on what changed
4. Commit the changes
5. Push to the remote repository

## Important

- Don't ask for confirmation — just do it
- If there are no changes to commit, say "Nothing to commit"
- Use conventional commit style if the project uses it
