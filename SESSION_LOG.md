## 2026-01-16 - Initial Guide Creation

**Changes:**
- Created full guide structure with 8 files:
  - README.md, 1_SETUP_GUIDE.md, 2_FIRST_SESSION.md, 3_WORKING_PRINCIPLES.md, 4_SLASH_COMMANDS.md
  - templates/STARTER_GLOBAL_CLAUDE.md, STARTER_PROJECT_CLAUDE.md, SESSION_LOG_TEMPLATE.md
- Setup guide: VS Code-first approach (not standalone Terminal), macOS terminology, Cmd+J shortcut, Homebrew for permissions (no sudo)
- First session: Added /rewind and /resume commands, Escape to stop
- Working principles: Split into 10 principles — key addition is phases → plan → execute workflow (Principles 2-4)
- Added dividers between all H2 sections across all files
- Deployed to GitHub: https://github.com/zoeydraws/starting-claude-code

**Decisions:**
- Target audience: UX folks and Design Managers (non-technical)
- Start from VS Code terminal, not standalone Terminal app
- Cmd+J for terminal (Mac-native), not Ctrl+`
- Homebrew for Node permission issues instead of sudo
- Split "one thing at a time" into three principles: break into phases, plan mode, execute step-by-step
- Removed "Next steps" from project CLAUDE.md template (belongs in SESSION_LOG only)

**Current State:**
- Working: Complete guide deployed to GitHub
- All 8 files have consistent formatting with dividers

**Next Steps:**
- Test guide with actual beginners for feedback
- Consider adding screenshots for key steps
- May need Windows version later
